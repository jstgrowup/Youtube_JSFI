// each binary data 0 and 1 is called bit for short
// to work with a piece of data a compter needs to convert that data into its binary representation
// base 2 numeric system
// 2^0*0
// for a character computers will first convert the character to a number then convert that number to its binary representation
// so for a character V it will convert the v to a number than that number to binary 
// character sets
//  character sets are predefined lists of characters represented by numbers
// popular character sets - Unicode and ASCII
// unicode character set dictates that 86 should represent character V
// Character encoding 
//  character encoding dictates how to represent  a number in a character set as binary data before it can be stored in a computer4
// it dictates how many bits to use to represent the number
// example of a character encoding system is UTF-8
// UTF-8 states that characters should be encoded in bytes 
// eight 1s and 0s should be used to represent the code of any character in binary
// 4 ==> 100 ==> 00000100
// V ==> 86 ==> 01010110
